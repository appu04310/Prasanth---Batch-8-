#To retrieve the names of all students majoring in "Computer Science", you can use this SQL query:

#To retrieve the details of the oldest student in the "Students" table, you can use this SQL query:

SELECT * FROM Students WHERE student_age = (SELECT MAX(student_age) FROM Students);


#To update the major of a student with a specific student_id, you can use the following SQL query as an example:

UPDATE Students SET student_major = 'New Major' WHERE student_id = 3;


#To delete a student with a specific student_id from the "Students" table, you can use this SQL query:


DELETE FROM Students WHERE student_id = 4;
